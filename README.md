# Branch

#### Motivations

Developed to create a CMS web-app for statistical posters and content submissions, reviews and readings.

This is mainly a small project to recreate the Database interface from `Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon`.

Another reason for the development of this project is to create a federated React.js web-app.

This React.js web-app was a way to help with sharing custom Armored Core builds from the game of the same name.

Mainly it's supposed to be a React.js version of the `mastiff-press/compcon` Vue.js web-app and employs the `fractalsoftworks.com/starfarer.api/` through IntelliJ's project structure for the Java Spring IO web-app: Conchord.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
